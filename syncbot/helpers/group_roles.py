"""Group ownership rules.

``role`` on ``workspace_group_members`` is descriptive except for ``owner``,
which is load-bearing: owners may promote another workspace, may leave only
while another active owner remains, and may disband a group they solely own and
solely publish into.

The invariant is **every group has an owner** — an active owner, or a retained
uninstalled owner during the retention window. Multiple owners is a normal,
legal state. It is a per-group aggregate, not a row property, so no database
constraint can express it; it lives here plus the backfill in migration
``003_group_roles``.

Ownership is lost only by choice. Uninstall, token revocation, and every other
offline event leave it intact: remaining members still see the group, with no
owner listed, until retention ends. After that window, the purge promotes the
earliest-joined remaining member, on this instance or another, or disbands
the group if none remain. ``PRIMARY_WORKSPACE`` may join or be invited like any other workspace; it is
never added or made owner for being primary. Home does not promote on read.

These are workspace-level gates that layer *on top of*
``helpers.is_workspace_manager``. Both must pass; neither replaces the other.

Imports submodules only, per the import-direction constraint in
``helpers/sync_cleanup.py``.
