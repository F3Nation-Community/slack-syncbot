# Backup, Restore, and Data Migration

## Full-Instance Backup and Restore

**`PRIMARY_WORKSPACE`** must be set to a Slack Team ID for backup and restore to show up. When it is set, the **Backup/Restore** button appears only in that workspace. When it is unset, backup and restore are hidden everywhere.

Use **Backup/Restore** on the Home tab (next to Refresh) to:

- **Download backup** — Generates a JSON file of the durable tables (workspaces, groups, syncs, channels, post meta, user directory, user mappings, federation, instance keys). Ephemeral Slack `event_id` claims are not included. The file is sent to your DM. The backup includes an HMAC for integrity and a hash of the encryption key. **Use the same `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` on the target instance** so restored bot tokens decrypt; otherwise workspaces must reinstall the app to re-authorize.
- **Restore from backup** — Paste the backup JSON in the modal and submit. Restore is meant for an **empty or fresh database** (for example after an AWS rebuild). If the encryption key hash or HMAC does not match, you will see a warning and can still proceed (for example if you edited the file on purpose).

After restore, Home tab caches are cleared so the next Refresh shows current data.

## Reset Database

Setting **`ENABLE_DB_RESET=true`** (with **`PRIMARY_WORKSPACE`** matching the current workspace) shows a **Reset Database** button on the Home tab. This is an advanced, destructive feature: it drops and reinitializes the entire database. The deploy scripts do not prompt for it. Set it in the env file (AWS `--setup-github` copies it when present) or in SAM / Terraform (`EnableDbReset` / `enable_db_reset`).

## Workspace Data Migration (Federation)

When **External Connections** is enabled, **Data Migration** (in that section) lets you:

- **Export** — Download a workspace-scoped JSON file (syncs, sync channels, post meta, user directory, user mappings) plus an optional one-time connection code so the new instance can connect to the source in one step. The file is signed (Ed25519) for tampering detection.
- **Import** — Paste a migration file, then submit. If the file includes a connection payload and you are not yet connected, the app establishes the federation connection and creates the group, then imports. Existing sync channels for that workspace in the federated group are **replaced** (replace mode). User mappings are imported where both workspaces exist on the new instance. If the signature check fails, a warning is shown but you can still proceed.

After import, Home tab and sync-list caches for that workspace are cleared.

### Instance A Behavior

When a workspace that used to be on Instance A connects to A from a new instance (B) via federation and sends its `team_id`, A soft-deletes the matching local workspace row so only the federated connection represents that workspace. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
