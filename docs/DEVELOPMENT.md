# Development Guide

This page is how to run SyncBot on your laptop (Dev Container, Docker Compose, or native Python) and how to manage dependencies. For **cloud deploy** and CI/CD, see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md). For runtime env vars in any environment, see [INFRA_CONTRACT.md](INFRA_CONTRACT.md).

## Branching (upstream vs downstream)

The **upstream** repository ([F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot](https://github.com/F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot)) is the shared codebase. Each deployment maintains its own **fork**:

| Branch | Role |
|--------|------|
| **`main`** | Tracks upstream. Use it to merge PRs and to **sync with the upstream repository** (`git pull upstream main`, etc.). |
| **`test`** / **`prod`** | On your fork, use these for **deployments**: GitHub Actions deploy workflows run on **push** to `test` and `prod` (see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)). |

Typical flow: develop on a feature branch → open a PR to **`main`** → merge → when you are ready to deploy, merge **`main`** into **`test`** or **`prod`** on your fork.

## Local development

### Dev Container (recommended)

**You need:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine on Linux) and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in VS Code.

1. Run `cp .env.example .env` and set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (`xoxb-...`).
2. Use **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** — Python, MySQL, and dependencies run inside the container.
3. Run `cd syncbot && python app.py`. The app listens on **port 3000** (forwarded).
4. Expose it to Slack with **cloudflared** or **ngrok** from the host, then set Slack **Event Subscriptions**, **Interactivity**, and **Redirect** URLs to that public origin (`/slack/events` and `/slack/oauth_redirect`). If you test **Authorize SyncBot**, the Home tab button always starts at this instance's `/slack/install` on the same origin. There is no `SYNCBOT_PUBLIC_URL` to set.

Optional **SQLite**: in `.env` set `DATABASE_BACKEND=sqlite` and `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/syncbot/syncbot.db`.

### Docker Compose (no Dev Container)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
docker compose up --build
```

App on port **3000**; restart the `app` service after code changes.

### Native Python

**You need:** Python 3.12+ and Poetry. Run MySQL locally (for example `docker run ... mysql:8`) or use SQLite. See [`.env.example`](../.env.example) and [INFRA_CONTRACT.md](INFRA_CONTRACT.md).

## Configuration reference

- **[`.env.example`](../.env.example)** — local env vars with comments.
- **[INFRA_CONTRACT.md](INFRA_CONTRACT.md)** — runtime contract for any cloud (DB, Slack, OAuth, production vs local).

```

## Dependency management

After `poetry add` / `poetry update`, keep `poetry.lock` and the pinned requirements files aligned:

- **Recommended:** Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) (`pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`). When you commit a change to `poetry.lock`, the **`sync-requirements`** hook runs `poetry export` and refreshes **`syncbot/requirements.txt`** automatically.

- **Without pre-commit:** Run the export yourself (Poetry 2.x needs the export plugin once: `poetry self add poetry-plugin-export`):

```bash
poetry export -f requirements.txt --without-hashes -o syncbot/requirements.txt
```

The root **`./deploy.sh`** does **not** run `poetry update`. If Poetry and `poetry-plugin-export` are on `PATH`, it may **warn** when committed `*requirements.txt` files differ from a lockfile export; it does not write those files or `poetry.lock`. Local and GitHub Actions deploys install the committed pins (same as `sam build`).

CI **`pip-audit`** exports from `poetry.lock` in the job (see [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)); it does not audit the committed `*requirements.txt` files. On **same-repo** PRs to **F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot**, **`requirements-sync`** may commit an export as **`f3n-community-automation[bot]`** (GitHub App token) **without** `[skip ci]` so required checks re-run on HEAD. A `GITHUB_TOKEN` push would not retrigger workflows. Fork PRs fail if the files are stale — run the pre-commit hook. If that bot commit lands on a Dependabot branch, comment **`@dependabot recreate`** so Dependabot can rebase (it refuses branches edited by others). On **push** to `main` / `test` / `prod`, a leftover mismatch may still commit with `[skip ci]`; the App is on the `main` ruleset bypass list so that push can succeed.

## Releases & Versioning

- **Conventional Commits** are required for squash-merged PR titles (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)); [.github/workflows/pr-title.yml](../.github/workflows/pr-title.yml) enforces the format (Dependabot uses `.github/dependabot.yml` prefixes).
- On **[F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot](https://github.com/F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot)** only, pushes to **`main`** run [.github/workflows/release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml) (**python-semantic-release** 9.21.2 via `pip`, with GitPython pinned below 3.1.60). GitPython 3.1.60 removed `Actor.name_email_regex`, which PSR 9.x still reads ([upstream #1476](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release/issues/1476)); the official Docker action rebuilds dependencies at job time and cannot pin that package. The job bumps `[tool.poetry] version` in `pyproject.toml`, inserts a Keep a Changelog section above `<!-- version list -->` from **feat** / **fix** / **perf** subjects only (`chore`, `ci`, `docs`, and Dependabot bodies are excluded), copies that section onto the **GitHub Release**, and tags the repo with `X.Y.Z` (no `v` prefix). Headings must be **Added** / **Changed** / **Fixed** (the templates map PSR's `bug fixes` / `Features`). Match **[1.2.0](../CHANGELOG.md)** for voice: operator-facing sentences with a capital first letter, not a dump of commit subjects. If that version heading is already in CHANGELOG, PSR keeps it — pre-write the notes in the release PR when you want the GitHub Release to ship polished. Otherwise polish the section (and the GitHub Release body) after the draft lands. Forks should **not** run a second release stream.
- Release commits, tags, and GitHub Releases are created via the **GitHub git API** as **`f3n-community-automation[bot]`** (GitHub App token) so they show as **Verified** and can bypass the `main` ruleset. `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `github-actions[bot]` cannot `updateRef` on a PR-required branch. After changing [release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml) or rotating the App, re-run **Actions → Release → Run workflow** if a computed release was skipped.
- Forks pull `main` and deploy **`test`** / **`prod`** themselves (see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)). There is no automated `main` → `test` promote PR from upstream.

## Required GitHub settings (manual)

These cannot be set from a PR — configure once on **F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot** under **Settings**:

- **Allow auto-merge**; default merge method **Squash** (use the PR title as the squash commit subject).
- **Branch protection / ruleset** on `main`: require a pull request; required checks **`ci-gate`** and **`conventional`** (the job name from [pr-title.yml](../.github/workflows/pr-title.yml), not “PR title / conventional”). Do **not** require Code Owners or resolved conversations. Prefer not requiring “branch must be up to date” until Dependabot rebase is confirmed.
- **Bypass list:** **Organization admin** (humans) and the GitHub App **`f3n-community-automation`** (see below). Do **not** add Dependabot, Write, or Maintain — Dependabot auto-merge already merges *through the PR* when checks pass; a Dependabot bypass would allow pushing to `main` without a PR. The built-in `github-actions[bot]` does **not** appear in the bypass picker (it is not an installable App).
- Dependabot **version updates** (from `.github/dependabot.yml`) and **security updates** enabled. Disable Dependabot on deploy forks (e.g. `f3-tulsa/syncbot`) so they do not open a second pile of PRs.
- **Secrets / variables** for deploy environments live on the **fork**, not on F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot — see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

### Automation GitHub App (`f3n-community-automation`)

This is the org’s **GitHub bot** (git push, PR merge, Release `updateRef`, ruleset bypass). It is **not** cloud deploy — AWS/GCP stay OIDC / WIF. Workflows that use it: [release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml), [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) (`requirements-sync`), [dependabot-auto-merge.yml](../.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml). Reuse it for later bot jobs on this repo; do not widen permissions until a job needs them.

Recreate from scratch:

1. Org **F3Nation-Community** → **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**.
2. **GitHub App name:** `f3n-community-automation`. Homepage URL: `https://github.com/F3Nation-Community`. Callback URL: leave blank. **Webhook: uncheck Active** (no events).
3. Repository permissions: **Contents** Read and write; **Pull requests** Read and write; **Issues** Read and write; **Metadata** Read. No org permissions. No user permissions.
4. Where can this App be installed: **Only on this account**. Create.
5. Note **App ID** (integer on the app settings page).
6. **Generate a private key** → download the `.pem` (store in a password manager; do not commit).
7. **Install App** → only **F3Nation-Community/slack-syncbot**.
8. Repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets** (not Environment secrets, not org secrets): add `AUTOMATION_APP_ID` (the integer) and `AUTOMATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (full PEM including `BEGIN`/`END` lines).
9. Repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Dependabot → Repository secrets**: **the same two names and values**. Dependabot-triggered workflows cannot read Actions secrets (`requirements-sync` and auto-merge run on Dependabot PRs).
10. Repo **Settings → Rulesets → Rulesets** (the `main` ruleset): **Bypass list** → add GitHub App `f3n-community-automation`. Do **not** add Dependabot, Write, or Maintain. Keep Organization admin for humans.

If you rotate the key or recreate the App: update **both** repository secret stores; re-add the **new** App on the ruleset (the old installation id will not match). Forks do not install this App and do not need these secrets.

## Commit signing (local)

Maintainers using **GPG-signed commits** should keep `commit.gpgsign` enabled locally; automated release and requirements-sync commits are signed as **`f3n-community-automation[bot]`** via the GitHub App. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [AI_AGENTS.md](AI_AGENTS.md).
